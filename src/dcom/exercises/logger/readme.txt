1. Start a nats server by running the "nats-server1.sh" script in this directory
( it may already be running - `docker ps` to see )
2. Build the publisher and subscriber applications on two different nodes
3. Modify the subscriber to take the messages it receives and append them to a text file.
4. Run the subscriber first - ./subscriber -s nats://server.ip.address:4222 mytopic
5. Run the publisher - ./publisher -s nats://server.ip.address:4222 mytopic

Question:

What happens when you publish while there is no subscriber running?
